# Myst

Myst is the vision of a cross-platform, self-expanding knowledgehub, based on customizability, usability and privacy.
We need a solution to accelerate the uncompromised share of knowledge and ideas so we can make wisdom accessible to the people.

Inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), an idea sparked by the Eleusinian Mysteries [[Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0FwCgmkG2Cfb36etijDIho?si=0b49fe3d09244bd4) or [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries)].

Upcoming: [myst.sh](https://myst.sh) (offline)

Info:  
I'm planning to use this to guide myself through my DevOps journey.  
The real work on the project will begin after the problems of automatic testing, deployment and scaling are fixed.  
Everything before that won't even be a full proof of concept.  
In the end I'd like to offer you something like [Michael Cade's](https://github.com/MichaelCade) [90 Days of DevOps](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) and a functional summary of [aCloudGuru's](https://acloudguru.com) DevOps, Azure and AWS courses with this project as a base to work through.  

"But you don't have to build python code?!" - you say...  
No problem. I'll have to build an electron client too...  
Oh god.
