# Myst

Myst is the vision of a cross-platform, self-expanding knowledgehub, based on customizability, usability and privacy.
We need a solution to accelerate the uncompromised share of knowledge and ideas so we can make wisdom accessible to the people.

Inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and the Eleusinian Mysteries [[Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0FwCgmkG2Cfb36etijDIho?si=0b49fe3d09244bd4) or [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries)].

Upcoming: [myst.sh](https://myst.sh) (offline)

What this repo is used for:
- to introduce you to my way of developing and storing ideas
- to show new developers the whole CICD cycle of such an application
