# Myst

Myst is the vision of a cross-platform, self-expanding knowledgehub, based on customizability, usability and privacy.
We need a solution to accelerate the uncompromised share of knowledge and ideas so we can make wisdom accessible to the people.

Inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), an idea sparked by the Eleusinian Mysteries [[Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0FwCgmkG2Cfb36etijDIho?si=0b49fe3d09244bd4) or [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries)].
